# Geopost
A cross-platform application for a geolocation-based social network.
Made with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Phonegap.

Essentially, every user follows one or more friends. Users can publish a state message (text) with the current detected location. 
A user can see the latest messages (with the positions) from his friends.

Main functionalities

### List
A user can see his friends' messages, ordered by distance from his current detected position.

## New Friend
A user can search and add another user as a friend with an autocomplete function.

## New State Message
A user can update his state writing a message. The message is associated with the detected current position.

The screen adapts according to the device orientation. If portrait, information is organized vertically. If landscape, information is organized horizontally (text on the left and map on the right).
